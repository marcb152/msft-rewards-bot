# Microsoft Rewards bot [French language only]
### I provide this bot as is, use it at your own risk!

A Python bot to exploit the Microsoft Rewards program.
This bot only work in French, as some `assert` are hardcoded (this is bad practice, I know).

See [the documentation](https://github.com/marcb152/msft-rewards-bot/releases) for more details.

## Information

This bot is a script coded entirely in Python within a few weeks. It has been made with the purpose of maximizing points and allowing automatic completion of rewards.
This is mainly a hobby project as there are many other Microsoft Rewards bots available on the internet. One notable difference, though, is that this bot uses the Selenium Stealth package, which provides better anti-bot protection.

***However, I am not responsible for the use of this script, I provide it “as is” and you use it at your own risk. Do not complain if your Microsoft account has been banned from the Rewards program. You must be aware of this risk when using this bot.***

This bot is not capable of validating all the rewards.

It is designed to be used on a daily basis, so that you will have almost no work left to do.

The bot will automatically create a text file on your Desktop containing additional information about all the rewards that have not been validated, if any.

### Features:

-	A decent anti-bot detection, thanks to [selenium-stealth](https://pypi.org/project/selenium-stealth/)
-	Support of 2FA-enabled Microsoft account (2 factors authentification)
-	Fast! Average total time of 02:40 and max of 03:15
-	Up to 5700 points per month (in theory)
-	Can create a text file on your Desktop listing all the rewards it has not been able to validate
